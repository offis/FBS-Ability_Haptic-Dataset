Here’s a cleaned-up version of your README text, with spelling, grammar, and sentence-structure mistakes fixed while keeping your original meaning intact:

# Haptic Dataset

In this repository, we publish a haptic dataset that was prepared using four different generation methods for haptic patterns and evaluated with eight Blind or Visually Impaired (BVI) users.

---

## Dataset

The folder **Dataset** contains the vibrotactile patterns saved as `.npy` files and the corresponding audio files saved as `.wav` files.

* The subfolder **02_Complete_Scheme** contains all the patterns (and their corresponding audio waveforms) used in the user study.
* The subfolder **01_Highest_Rated_Scheme** contains only the patterns and audio waveforms that received the highest median score from users.

Inside each of these folders, the patterns are organized by the material they were designed to represent. The material categories are:

1. Ceramic
2. Denim
3. Felt
4. Glass
5. Leather
6. Plastic
7. Stone
8. Water
9. Wood

## Generation Methods

The patterns differ by generation method, as indicated by the file prefix:

1. **`o3_*`**

   * Directly generated using OpenAI GPT-o3 without intermediary audio.
   * Therefore, no corresponding audio waveform exists for these patterns.
   * The term following the prefix indicates the object used as a reference when prompting GPT-o3.
   * Example: For "Ceramic," the file `o3_Ceramic_Plate_LP300Hz.npy` means GPT-o3 was prompted to simulate interaction with a ceramic object (such as a plate), with an image provided as reference.

2. **`AI_MyEdit_*`**

   * Based on audio generated by the text-to-audio model [MyEdit](https://myedit.online/en/audio-editor/ai-sound-effect-generator/edit).

3. **`Real_Recording_*`**

   * Based on audio recordings of real human–finger interactions with the material.

4. **`Literature_HDB_*`**

   * Based on audio recordings from the [Cluster Haptic Texture Database](https://github.com/cluster-lab/Cluster-Haptic-Texture-Database).
   * The term following the prefix denotes the exact material recording used from the database.
   * Example: For "Leather," the file `Literature_HDB_CowLeather_Leather` indicates that the "Cow Leather" recording from the database was used as the representative audio for the category "Leather."

## Data Analysis

The folder **Data Analysis** contains the results of the user study and the quantitative analysis performed on them.

* The subfolder **01_Violin_Plots** contains all participant responses in a CSV file (`study_rankings.csv`) and a Python script used to generate violin plots showing the score distribution for individual materials.
* The subfolder **02_Statistical_Results** contains an Excel spreadsheet with all participant responses and additional calculations across these values, such as averages, medians, interquartile ranges, and medians of medians.

Would you like me to also **tighten the style** (e.g., make it more concise and “publication-like”) or do you prefer it to stay **instructional and descriptive** as it is now?
